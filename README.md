2. Smallest Distance Between Neighboring Numbers

Description: A Java function that finds two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance and returns the index of the first number.

Files:*

SmallestDistanceFinder.java (Contains the function implementation)

3. Array to ArrayList and Vice Versa

Description: A program to convert an array into an ArrayList and an ArrayList back into an array.

Files:*

ArrayConverter.java (Handles conversions)
